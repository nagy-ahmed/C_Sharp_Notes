# 1. Cursor
- how to deal the ResultSet row by row [like For loop for rows]
> Steps:
![](Images/10_06-14-22-12.png)

- Declare the cursor

    ```sql
    declare c1 cursor
    for 
        select st_id , st_fname
        from student
        where st_address = 'cairo'
    for read only       --means that the cursor can be used to read the rows
    --or for update     --means that the cursor can be used to update the rows
    ```

- variable declaration
    ```sql
    declare @id int , @name varchar(50)
    ```

- Open the cursor
    ```sql
    open c1
    ```

- Fetch the rows
    ```sql
    fetch c1 into @id , @name
    ```

- Loop
    ```sql
    while @@fetch_status = 0
        begin
           select @id , @name
            fetch c1 into @id , @name  --fetch the next row like index++
        end
    ```
- Close the cursor
    ```sql
    close c1
    ```
- Deallocate the cursor
    ```sql
    deallocate c1
    ```
>   - **Full Example**
>   
>       ```sql
>       declare c1 cursor
>       for 
>           select st_id , st_fname
>           from student
>           where st_address = 'cairo'
>       for read only
>   
>       declare @id int , @name varchar(50)
>   
>       open c1
>   
>       fetch c1 into @id , @name
>   
>       while @@fetch_status = 0
>           begin
>               select @id , @name
>               fetch c1 into @id , @name
>           end
>   
>       close c1
>       deallocate c1
>       ```

- Result

        fetch c1 into @name
    end

select @all_names

close c1
deallocate c1

```

# 2. Backup and Restore

- **Types of Backup**
    - **Full Backup**
        - backup from creation to current state
        - make backup of mdf files
            
            ![](Images/10_06-15-28-51.png)
            by the time the size of backup will increased
    
    - **Differential Backup**
      - backup from last full backup to current state
      - make backup of mdf files
        
        ![](Images/10_06-15-30-35.png)
        by the time the size of backup will increased

    - **Transaction Log Backup**
      - backup from last backup(full or diff or trans) to current state in the log file
      - then the log file will be truncated
      - log file can used to recover the database to any time you want
        
        ![](Images/10_06-15-35-38.png)

    > has this also in case i separate the db into several FileGroup - FileGroup Backup
___
- **Backup**
 
 
  - `the correct way to make backup`
 
      - Full Backup every long time (month) so you have the full database
      - Differential Backup every short time (week) so you have the changes
      - Transaction Log Backup every short time (day , hour) so you have the changes
 
    ![](Images/10_06-15-43-24.png)
    - so you have more flexibility to restore the database to any time you want
    
  - `Practical`
    - if i take full backup and then differential backup and then transaction log backup 
    `in same file or each in separated files`
        - right click on the database
        - Tasks -> Backup
        - select the type of backup
        - select the destination

    - Because i use same file to backup all backups so when selected appeared as multiple files
        
        ![](Images/10_06-15-51-08.png)
    
        can restore to `full` or `full + diff` or `transaction log` so must restore last diff or full before it 
    
    - So can use `timeline` to restore the database to any time you want
    
        ![](Images/10_06-15-53-55.png)
- SQL
    ```sql
    backup database [ITI]
    to disk = 'd:\ITI.bak'
    ```
___
## 2.1. Jobs
- can make automatic backup -> **Job**
- `Job` is a set of tasks that can be scheduled to run at a specific time
- it's exist in services called `SQL Server Agent`
- then make new job 
- add the query to the job
- schedule the job to run at specific time
- then the job will run automatically at the specified time
___
# 3. Identity Gap
- when delete row from table the identity will not be reused
  
  - if has 10 rows and delete the 5th row the next insert will be 11 not 6

- To get identity value
    ```sql
    select @@identity   --return the last identity value of last query

    select IDENT_CURRENT('table_name')
    ```

<br>

- `First Solution` :
    > - identity by default can't insert inside it
    >   
    >    - but can be changed
    >        
    >        ```sql
    >        set identity_insert test_table on   --to allow insert inside identity
    >        -- so here i can full the gap by insert the identity value i want
    >        
    >        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    >        
    >        -- then return it to default
    >        set identity_insert test_table off      --to disallow insert inside identity
    >        ```

- `Second Solution` :
    >```sql
    >dbcc checkident('table_name' , reseed , new_identity_value)
    >``` 

# 4. Bulk Insert
Types of insert
- simple insert `one row`
- insert constructor `multiple rows`
- insert select `insert from another table`
- insert exec `insert from stored procedure`
- bulk insert `insert from file`
  
```sql
bulk insert Employees
from 'd:\employees.txt'
with (fieldterminator = ',' , rowterminator = '\n')
```
- employees.txt
    ```
    1,Ahmed,1000
    2,Mohamed,2000
    ```

# 5. Snapshots
- `Snapshot` is a read-only database
- `Snapshot` is a copy of the database at specific time, pointer to the original database

1. **First take snapshot**
    
    ![](Images/10_06-16-28-56.png)

2. **when data changed**
    
    - Delete two rows , will delete it from original database and take it to snapshot and remove the pointer
    ![](Images/10_06-16-29-41.png)

    - update one row , will update it in original database and take the old value to snapshot and remove the pointer
    ![](Images/10_06-16-31-15.png)

    - when insert it will not affect the snapshot
        
        ![](Images/10_06-16-32-35.png)
        - Select from Original 
            ```
            sid   sname     age
            1     Ahmed     22
            4     Sally     28
            9     Ahmed     21
            ```
        - Select from Snapshot
            ```
            sid   sname     age
            1     Ahmed     22
            2     Eman      21
            3     Omer      25
            4     Sally     22
            ```
>So snapshot is lighter than Backup because it not copy the whole database
> - But it exists in the same server
> - can't copy it to another server like backup
___
- Practical
    ```sql
    create database iti_snapshot
    on
    (
        name = 'iti',                     -- the name of mdf file of database
        filename = 'd:\iti_snapshot.ss'   -- ss is the extension of snapshot  -- which is the pointer of the original database
    )
    as 
        snapshot of iti
    ```
    
# 6. SQLCLR
- `SQLCLR` is a feature of SQL Server that allows you to run .NET code inside SQL Server
  - make complicated function in C# which is faster than function in SQL 
  - write new data type [class , struct] in C# and use it in SQL

```sql
sp_configure 'clr enabled' , 1
go 
reconfigure
 
-- Configuration option 'clr enabled' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.
```

- **Function**
  1. Create new project on Visual Studio
  2. select SQL Server Database Project
  3. add new item -> SQL CLR C# -> User Defined Function
  4. write the function
     
     ```csharp
      public static sqlint16 sum2int(sqlint16 a , sqlint16 b)
      {
          return a + b;
      }
      ```
  5. build the project
  6. publish the project to specific database
  7. then the function will be in the database
      ```sql
      select dbo.sum2int(5,6)
      ```
      ```sql
      select dbo.sum2int(st_id , st_age) 
      from student
      ```
    ___
- **New Data Type**

    1. Create new project on Visual Studio
    2. select SQL Server Database Project
    3. add new item -> SQL CLR C# -> User Defined Data Type
    4. write the class
        - consider two function `Parse` and `ToString`
        
        ```csharp
        public class Circle
        {
            public int x , y , rad;
            
            // Parse function to convert string to object
            public static MyType Parse(SqlString s)
            {
                if(s.IsNull)
                    return null;
                Circle mt = new Circle();

                string[] arr = s.Value.Split(',');
                mt.x = int.Parse(arr[0]);
                mt.y = int.Parse(arr[1]);
                mt.rad = int.Parse(arr[2]);

                return mt;
            }

            // ToString function to convert object to string
            public override string ToString()
            {
                return $"MyCircle = {x},{y},{rad}";
            }
        }
        ```
    5. build the project
    6. publish the project to specific database
    7. then the data type will be in the database
        ```sql
        create table shapes
        (
            id int,
            _coords Circle
        )
        ```
        ```sql
        insert into shapes values(1 , '10,20,30')   --insert the object as string 
                                                    --and the Parse function will convert it to object
        ```

        ```sql
        select * from shapes
        
        -- id   shape
        -- 1    MyCircle = 10,20,30                 -- the ToString function will convert the object to string
        ```
        ```sql
        select _coords.x , _coords.y , _coords.rad from shapes
        ```
        ```
        x   y   rad
        10  20  30
        ```
