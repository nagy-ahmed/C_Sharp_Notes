# 1. Joins
- Types of Joins
1. **Cross Join**
   - cartesian product

2. **Inner Join**
   - Equi Join

3. **Outer Join**
   - Left Outer Join
   - Right Outer Join
   - Full Outer Join

4. **Self Join**

> To make yourself owner of Database , you go to DB Properties -> Files -> Owner `sa` Sql Admin -> OK

## 1.1. Cartesian Product:
When we join two tables without any condition, it will return all the rows of first table with all the rows of second table. It is also known as Cross Join.
- Combination of all rows of first table with all rows of second table.
- Number of rows in result set = Number of rows in first table * Number of rows in second table.    
```sql
 select SName , DName from Student, Department
--  both are same as below
 select SName , DName from Student cross join Department
```
![alt text](images/JoinTables.png)  ---->> ![alt text](images/crossJoin.png)

## 1.2. Inner Join:
- Inner join is the most common type of join which is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
- **Equi Join**: because we are using `=` operator to join two tables.
- Ansi SQL
    ```sql
    select SName , DName 
    from Student , Department
    where Student.DId = Department.DId
    ```
- T-SQL
    ```sql
    select SName , DName 
    from Student S inner join Department D
    -- using alias because both tables have same column name
    on S.DId = S.DId
    ```

## 1.3. Outer Join:

1. **Left Outer Join**
    - It returns all the rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL from the right side.
    ```sql
    select SName , DName 
    from Student S left join Department D
    on S.DId = D.DId
    ```
    ![alt text](images/LeftJoin.png)
2. **Right Outer Join**
    - It returns all the rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If there is no match, the result is NULL from the left side.
    ```sql
    select SName , DName 
    from Student S right join Department D
    on S.DId = D.DId
    ```
    ![alt text](images/RightJoin.png)

3. **Full Outer Join**
    - It returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables. It returns all rows from both tables and NULL where there is no match.
    ```sql
    select SName , DName 
    from Student S full join Department D
    on S.DId = D.DId
    ```
    ![alt text](images/FullJoins.png)


## 1.4. Self Join:
- Self Join is a join used to join a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.  

![alt text](images/SelfJoin.png)
```sql
select x.EName as Employee , y.EName as Manager
-- so here you need name of Employee From Employee Table X
-- and name of Manager from Employee Table Y

from Employee x , Employee y

where y.EId = x.SuperId 
-- x.superId is id of manager of the employee X object ------------this table is the table in DB
-- y.EId is the manager object ------------this table is the table not in DB i just supposed it
-- where y.EId = x.SuperId 
-- -----Parent---Child 
-- -----Super ---Employee
```
![alt text](images/SelfJoinSQL.png) 
- Table with `PK` is the `Parent` Table and Table with `FK` is the `Child` Table.
- --------------`Super Table`----------------------------`Employee Table`------.
![alt text](images/SelfJoinTables.png)
- this will make two version of tables in the memory and then join them.


## 1.5. Practicing:
___
### 1.5.1. Multiple Joins
```sql
select st_Fname , crs_Name , grade
from Student , Stud_Course , Course
where Student.st_id = Stud_Course.st_id and Stud_Course.Crs_id=Course.Crs_Id
```
or with inner join T-SQL which work with two tables at a time
```sql
select st_Fname , crs_Name , grade
from Student join Stud_Course
        on Student.st_id = Stud_Course.st_id
    join Course
        on Stud_Course.Crs_id=Course.Crs_Id
```
___
### 1.5.2. Join with update
- increase grade of all students by 10 who are enrolled in course `java`
  - first to show the grades of java course 
    ```sql
        select crs_Name , grade
        from  Stud_Course , Course
        where  Stud_Course.Crs_id=Course.Crs_Id and Crs_Name='java'
    ```
  - then replace the select with update
      ```sql
        update Stud_Course
            set grade = grade + 10
        where  Stud_Course.Crs_id=Course.Crs_Id and Crs_Name='java'
        -- where Crs_id = (select Crs_Id from Course where Crs_Name='java')
      ```
___
### 1.5.3. Join with delete
- delete all students who are enrolled in course `java`
  - first to show the students who are enrolled in java course 
    ```sql
        select st_Fname , st_Lname
        from  Student , Stud_Course , Course
        where Student.st_id = Stud_Course.st_id and Stud_Course.Crs_id=Course.Crs_Id and Crs_Name='java'
    ```
  - then replace the select with delete
      ```sql
        delete from Stud_Course
        where  Stud_Course.Crs_id=Course.Crs_Id and Crs_Name='java'
      ```
___
# 2. Some Useful Functions
## 2.1. isnull() function
- if the value is null then it will replace it with the value you provide 
```sql
select isnull(st_Fname,'No Name') as st_Fname
from Student
```
- but if the second value is also null then it will return null
```sql
select isnull(st_Fname,st_lname) as Name
from Student
```

___
## 2.2. coalesce() function
- it will return the first not null value
```sql
select Coalesce(st_Fname,st_lname , st_address , 'No Data') as Name
-- take mutiple columns and return the first not null value
from Student
```
___
## 2.3. convert() function
- if i want to concatenate two columns of different data types
```sql
select st_Fname + st_id
-- this will give error because one is string and other is int
from Student
```
- so we can convert the int to string
```sql
select st_Fname + convert(varchar,st_age)
from Student
```
- but if the value is null then it will return null
```sql
select isnull(st_Fname,'') + convert(varchar,isnull(st_age,0))
from Student
```
- But this is affect on the performance so can use `concat() function`
  
___
## 2.4. concat() function
- it will convert all the values to string and then concatenate them and if the value is null then it will return empty string
```sql
select concat(st_Fname , st_age)
from Student
```
___
## 2.5. getdate() function
- it will return the current date and time
```sql
select getdate()
```
- if you want only the date
```sql
select convert(date,getdate())
```
- if you want only the time
```sql
select convert(time,getdate())
```
- if you want to add or subtract (-)
 
  ```sql
  select dateadd(day,10,getdate())

  select dateadd(month,10,getdate())

  select dateadd(year,10,getdate())

  select dateadd(hour,10,getdate())
  ```
___
## 2.6. year() , month() , day() , hour()
```sql
select year(getdate())

select month(getdate())

select day(getdate())

select hour(getdate())
```

___

## 2.7. datename() function
- if you want to get the day name
```sql
select datename(day,getdate())
```
- if you want to get the month name
```sql
select datename(month,getdate())
```
___
## 2.8. datediff() function
- it will return the difference between two dates
```sql
select datediff(day,'2021-01-01',getdate())
```
___
## 2.9. substring() function
- it will return the part of the string
```sql
select substring('Hello World',1,5) -- Hello
-- 1 is the starting index and 5 is the length
```
___
## 2.10. len() function
- it will return the length of the string
```sql
select len('Hello World') -- 11
```
___
## 2.11. db_name() function
- it will return the name of the current database
```sql
select db_name() -- ITI
```
___
## 2.12. suser_name() function
- it will return the name of the current user
```sql
select suser_name() -- sa    -- sql admin
```
___
## 2.13. like operator
- it is used to search for a specified pattern in a column.
  - `%` zero or more of characters.
  - `_` single character.
  - `[]` any one character in the list.
  - `[^]` any one character not in the list.
  - `[a-z]` any one character in the range.
  - `[!a-z]` any one character not in the range.
  - `^` start with.
  - `$` end with.

```sql
select * from Student
where st_Fname like 'A%'
-- this will return all the students whose name start with A
```

**some examples**
- `a%h` start with `a` and end with `h`
- `%a_` second last character is `a`
- `ahm%` start with `ahm`
- `[ahm]%` start with `a` or `h` or `m`

# 3. Normalization 

DB Design | ERD : create new database from scratch <br> Normalization : already have database and want to improve it
-|-
ERD , Normalization | Both are used to design database to result the correct Mapping (Schema) of the database

**Normalization** : is the process of structuring data to minimize duplications and inconsistencies.  
the process usually involves breaking down a single table into Two or More tables and defining relationships between those tables
- also when DML Anomalies 
  - Insertion Anomaly : adding new rows forces to create duplicate data
  - Deletion Anomaly : deleting rows may cause losing data that would be needed for other future records
  - Update Anomaly : Changing data in row forces to update multiple rows

![alt text](images/normalization.png)

## 3.1. Functional Dependency
- it is a relationship between two attributes. when correct DB : A -> B,C,D | PK-->Columns
- if we know the value of one attribute, we can determine the value of the other attribute.
- **Types**
  - **Full Functional Dependency** : attribute is fully functional dependency on a PK if its value is determined by the whole PK.
  <br> `A -> B , A -> C , A -> D`
  - **Partial Functional Dependency** : attribute is partially functional dependency on a PK if its value is determined by a part of PK(Composite key).
  <br> `A,B -> C , A -> D`
  - **Transitive Functional Dependency** : attribute is transitively functional dependency if its value is determined by another non-key attribute , which itself determined by PK.
  <br> `A -> B , B -> C`

- Ex:
  **Fully** | **Sid , Subject -> Grade**
  -|-
  **Partial** | **Sid -> Sname  <br>  Subject -> Teacher <br> partial of composite key**
  **Transitive** | **ZipCode -> City <br> both non-key**

## 3.2. Normal Forms
- **1NF** : each column should have atomic values (no repeating groups or arrays)<br>
  - Repeating Groups : set of attributes that are repeating values of other attributes المسبب للتكرار (Project )   
  - Repeated Attributes : values that repeated like Employee due to many Projects
- **2NF** : 1NF + `no partial functional` dependency<br>
  Partial Functional Dependency : non-key attribute is determined by a part of PK
- **3NF** : 2NF + `no transitive functional`<br>
  Transitive Functional Dependency : non-key attribute is determined by another non-key attribute
![alt text](images/Normalform.png)

### 3.2.1. 1NF
- relation is in first normal form if it contains no multivalued or repeating groups
- remove repeating groups to a new table as already demonstrated, "carrying" the PK as a FK
- All columns (fields) must be atomic
  - Means: no repeating items in columns

![alt text](images/1NF_1.png)
![alt text](images/1NF_2.png)

### 3.2.2. 2NF
- a relation is in second normal form if it is in first normal form AND every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependant on the primary key
- i.e. remove partial functional dependencies, so no non-key attribute depends on just part of the key
- First table  
![alt text](images/2NF_1.png)
- Second table
![alt text](images/2NF_2.png) -|
![alt text](images/2NF_4.png)

### 3.2.3. 3NF
- 2NF PLUS no transitive dependencies (one attribute functionally determines a second, which functionally determines a third)
- this is 3NF already ![alt text](images/3NF_1.png)
- but this has TFD ![alt text](images/3NF_2.png)
so we can break it into two tables ![alt text](images/3NF_2.png)
