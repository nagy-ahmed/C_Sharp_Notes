# 1. Application Structure
- The structure of ASP.NET MVC application.
  - Services
  - Dependencies
    - 
  - Properties
    - launchSettings.json
      - Configurations for the application
      - Environment variables
      - Debugging configurations
      - Profiles
      - IIS Express configurations
      - Application URL
      - SSL configurations
      - etc.
  - wwwroot
    - Static Files
    - Client-side Libraries (css, js)
    - Images
  
  - Controllers
  - Models
  - Views
  
  - appsettings.json
    - Configuration of the application (connection strings, etc.)
  - Program.cs
    - Entry point of the application
    
    ```csharp
      var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args); // Create a new instance of WebApplicationBuilder

      // Add services to the container.
      builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();
      // so any service that is registered in the container can be used in the application
      var app = builder.Build(); // Build the application

      // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
      if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
      // this variable is configured in the launchSettings.json file to determine the environment of the application (development, production, etc.)
      {
          app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
          // used in the development environment to show detailed error messages to the developer
          // in the production environment, should be replaced with a custom error page
          app.UseHsts();
      }

      app.UseHttpsRedirection();
      // redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS
      app.UseStaticFiles();
      // serve static files from the wwwroot folder

      app.UseRouting();

      app.UseAuthorization();

      app.mapControllers(
        name: "default",
        pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}"
      ); // map the controllers to the application

      app.Run();


    ```

# 2. Routing
`/Controller/Action/Id`  

>(/Books/create)
  - First: The name of the controller
  - Second: The name of the action
> /Books/Edit/1
- Third: The id of the object
> /Books/Edit?BookId=1
- Query string format 

# 3. Controllers
- Controllers are the entry point of the application
- class that inherits from the Controller class in the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc namespace
- Actions are methods in the controller class
- Actions are responsible for handling the requests and returning the responses
- Actions can return different types of results (ViewResult, JsonResult, etc.)
- Actions can have parameters

# 4. Views
- Views are responsible for rendering the response
- .cshtml files with HTML and C# code mixed together with Razor syntax

- Shared folder: Contains shared views that can be used in multiple views
  <!-- - _ViewStart.cshtml: Contains the code that is executed before rendering any view -->
  - _layout.cshtml: The layout of the application (header, footer, etc.)
    - @RenderBody(): Renders the content of the view rendered by the action
    - @await RenderSectionAsync("Scripts", required: false): Renders the scripts section of the view
      - @section Scripts { ... }: Defines the scripts section in the view so can render the scripts in the layout  
  
- can pass data between views layout and views using viewdata
  - in the view we set the viewdata to passed to layout to put like the title
    ```csharp 
      @{ 
          viewdata["Title"] = "Home Page"; 
        }
    ```
  - in the layout we use the viewdata to set the title
    ```csharp
      <title>@ViewData["Title"] - My ASP.NET Application</title>
    ```

- _ViewStart.cshtml: Contains the code that is executed before rendering any view shared between all views
  - set the layout of the view
    ```csharp
      @{
          Layout = "_Layout";
      }
    ```

- change the default layout of the view
  - in the view we use the layout attribute to set the layout
    ```csharp
      @{
          Layout = "test";
      }
    ```


- Razor engine convert the c# code to Html to make the browser understand it
  - @: to write C# code
  - @@ to write @

- **Returning a view from the controller**
  ```csharp
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
        // view is a method in the controller class that returns a ViewResult object 
    }
  ```
  This will return the view with the same name as the action (Index.cshtml)
  - Search for the view in the Views folder of the controller
  - Search for the view in the Shared folder
  
- **Partial Views**
  
  - Partial views are views that can be rendered inside other views
    - Something like a component in Angular or React 
  
  - They can be used to render common parts / Components of the application (header, footer, etc.)
      - The name of the partial view should start with an underscore (_)
      - The partial view should be in the same folder as the view or in the Shared folder
      - The partial view should have the .cshtml extension
  
  - They can be rendered using the `Partial` in the view
    ```csharp
      @Html.Partial("_PartialViewName")

      //or 
      
      <partial name="_PartialViewName" />
    ```
    - css isolation : if we have a css file with the same name of the view will be applied to the view only
      - index.cshtml.css will be applied to index.cshtml only , `not also to partial views in the index.cshtml`
      - to apply the css to the partial view we should add the css file to the partial view or add it to site.css  

# 5. Passing Data to Views
## 5.1. ViewData
- ViewData is a dictionary Property in the controller class that can be used to pass data from the controller to the view in the request pipeline
```csharp
  public IActionResult Index()
  {
      ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
      return View();
  }
```
```csharp
  <h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>
```

## 5.2. ViewBag
- ViewBag is a dynamic property in the controller class
```csharp
  public IActionResult Index()
  {
      ViewBag.MyTitle = "Home Page";
      return View();
  }
```
```csharp
  <h1>@ViewBag.MyTitle</h1>
```

## 5.3. TempData
- TempData is a dictionary property in the controller class that can be used to pass data between action and view and also between actions

- **Between action and view**
  ```csharp
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        TempData["Message"] = "Hello, World!";
        return View();
    }
  ```
  ```csharp
    <h1>@TempData["Message"]</h1>
  ```

- TempData is used to pass data **between actions** in the same request

  ```csharp
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        TempData["Message"] = "Hello, World!";
        //return RedirectToAction("About"); // this just string not validated by the compiler if the action name is wrong it will not show an error
        return RedirectToAction(nameof(index)); // this will validate the action with the compiler
    }
  ```
  ```csharp
    public IActionResult About()
    {
        var message = TempData["Message"];
        return View();
    }
  ```
  in the about view we can use the message variable assigned in the index action to show the message
  ```csharp
    <h1>@TempData["Message"]</h1>
  ```
  - TempData is used to pass data between actions in the same request

## 5.4. View Models
- The model is a class that contains the data that will be displayed in the view
- The model is passed to the view using the `View(object? model)` method in the controller
> ### Model class 
> - Two Types of Models
>   - Domain Model: Represents the data of the application
>   - View Model: Represents the data that will be displayed in the view

- Strongly typed views are views that are bound to a model

  ```csharp
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var book = new Book { Id = 1, Title = "Book Title", Author = "Author Name" };
        return View(book);
    }
  ```
  ```csharp
    // @model BookApp.Models.Book
    // Or
    @model Book // must add the namespace of the model to the _ViewImports.cshtml file
    
    <h1>@Model.Title</h1>
    <h2>@Model.Author</h2>
  ```
  _ViewImports.cshtml file
  ```csharp
    @using BooksApp
    @using BooksApp.Models
  ```

- List of Models
  ```csharp
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var books = new List<Book>
        {
            new Book { Id = 1, Title = "Book 1", Author = "Author 1" },
            new Book { Id = 2, Title = "Book 2", Author = "Author 2" },
            new Book { Id = 3, Title = "Book 3", Author = "Author 3" }
        };
        return View(books);
    }
  ```
  ```csharp
    @model IEnumerable<Book>
    <ul>
        @foreach (var book in Model)
        {
            <li>@book.Title - @book.Author</li>
        }
    </ul>
  ```

### Passing Data to Partial Views
- Partial views can be passed data using the `@model` directive
  ```csharp
    @model IEnumerable<Book>
    <ul>
        @foreach (var book in Model)
        {
           <partial name="_PartialViewName" model=@book />
        }
    </ul>
  ```
  in the partial view we can use the model passed to the partial view
  ```csharp
    @model Book
    <li>@Model.Title - @Model.Author</li>
  ```
