## 1. Helper
- the helper is a method that returns a string that is used in the view to generate HTML content.


- Pure HTML
    ```html
    <input type="text" name="Address" id="Address" value="@Model.Address"/>
    ```
    - By default the method of the form is `GET`.

### 1.1. Helper
    - use the `@Html` object to call the helper methods that generate HTML content.
    - to make sure that the binding is correct but it rewrite the code of html again.
    
        ```html
        <!-- this will generate the above code -->
        @Html.TextBox("Address")  <!-- Loosely type helper -->
                                <!-- this will search for the Address in ViewData, ViewBag, Model -->
        
        @Html.CheckBox("IsAdmin")
        @Html.RadioButton
        @Html.DropDownList
        @Html.Password
        ```
  - Strongly type helper
      ```html
      @Html.TextBox("Address" , @Model.Address)  <!-- Strongly type helper -->
      @Html.TextBoxFor(model => model.Address)  <!-- Strongly type helper -->
      ```
  - Also can use styles
      ```html
      @Html.TextBoxFor(model => model.Address, new { @class = "form-control" })
      ```
  - @Html.EditorFor
      - this will generate the HTML for the property based on the data type of the property.
      
          ```csharp
          [DataType(DataType.Password)]
          public string Password { get; set; }
          ```
          ```html
          @Html.EditorFor(model => model.Password)
          <!-- although the Password is a string, the EditorFor will generate a password input. -->
          ```

### 1.2. Tag Helpers
- Tag Helpers are a new feature in ASP.NET Core that allow `server-side attribute` to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files.
- also make sure that the binding is correct.
- all the tag helpers are in the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers` namespace.
- begin with the `asp-` prefix.
- when using tag helpers the default method of the form is `POST`.
```html
<!-- asp-for : the property that the input is bound to. -->
<input asp-for="Address" class="form-control" />
```
- `asp-for` : the property that the input is bound to.
- `asp-controller` : the controller that the form is posted to.
- `asp-action` : the action that the form is posted to.
- `asp-route-id` : the id that is passed to the action.

What to use to generate list of items?
- `asp-items` : the list of items that the select element is bound to.
    
    - this is a `SelectList` which is `IEnumerable<SelectListItem>` with the `Value` and `Text` properties.
        
        >```html
        ><select asp-for="City" asp-items="ViewBag.Cities" class="form-control"></select>
        >```
        >```csharp
        >ViewBag.Cities = new SelectList(new List<SelectListItem>
        >{
        >    new SelectListItem { Value = "1", Text = "Cairo" },
        >    new SelectListItem { Value = "2", Text = "Alex" },
        >    new SelectListItem { Value = "3", Text = "Giza" }
        >}, "Value", "Text");
        >```
    - or
        >```csharp
        >ViewBag.Cities = new List<City>
        >{
        >    new City { Id = "1", Name = "Cairo" },
        >    new City { Id = "2", Name = "Alex" },
        >    new City { Id = "3", Name = "Giza" }
        >};
        >```
        >```html
        >@{
        >    SelectList cities = new SelectList(ViewBag.Cities, "Id", "Name");
        >                <!-- constructor of SelectList take the list, the value property, the text property -->
        >}
        ><select asp-for="City" asp-items="cities" class="form-control"></select>
        >```


## 2. Layout
- the layout is a shared view that contains the common layout of the application.

- the layout view is in the `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` shared to all views.

- and the the view will render in the `@RenderBody()` method.
- `@RenderSection("name", required: false)` : to render many section in the layout.
  - one body and many sections.

**How to use the layout?**
- each view has `Layout` property.
   
    ```html
    @{
        Layout = "_Layout";
    }
    ```
- never use any Layout
   
    ```html
    @{
        Layout = null;
    }
    ```
**Sections in the layout**
- to define a section in the layout.
    ```html
    @RenderSection("MyScripts", required: false)
    ```
  
  - to define a section in the view.
  
    ```html
    @section MyScripts {
        <script>
            alert("Hello");
        </script>
    }
    ```
**Default Layout**
- to set the default layout for all views.
- in the `_ViewStart.cshtml` file.
    ```html
    @{
        Layout = "_Layout";
    }
    ```
